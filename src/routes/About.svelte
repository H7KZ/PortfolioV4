				My name is Jan Komínek, and I am a Fullstack Engineer with a keen interest in creating user-friendly and dynamic web applications. I graduated from
				Smíchovská střední průmyslová škola a gymnázium, specializing in cybersecurity, with a full score in technical subjects.<br /><br />
				I am particularly skilled in SvelteKit and TailwindCSS and have extensive experience with TypeScript, VueJS, ReactJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB. Additionally,
				I have experience working with Raspberry Pi, hardware connections, and firmware development. I thrive in collaborative environments, working closely with
				both technical and non-technical stakeholders to deliver outstanding results.<br /><br />
				As a Fullstack Engineer, I am committed to creating applications that are both technically excellent and user-friendly. I stay up-to-date with the latest
				trends and best practices in my field and am always eager to take on new challenges and expand my skillset.<br /><br />
				My exceptional skills in Fullstack Engineering, combined with my experience in hardware and firmware, my ability to work collaboratively, and my commitment
