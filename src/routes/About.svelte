				I am Jan Komínek, a Fullstack Engineer passionate about developing user-friendly and dynamic web applications. I specialize in SvelteKit, TailwindCSS,
				and have extensive experience with TypeScript, VueJS, ReactJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB. With a background in cybersecurity from Smíchovská střední
				průmyslová škola a gymnázium, where I excelled in technical subjects, I am now furthering my education at the University of Economics and Business,
